PHAS0100Assignment3
------------------

Purpose
-------

This is a demo project to demonstrate a reasonable structure for [CMake](https://cmake.org/) based projects,
that use [CTest](https://cmake.org/) to run unit tests via [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2),
specifically demonstrating some uses of MPI.


Credits
-------

This project was originally developed as a teaching aid for UCL's ["Research Computing with C++"](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/research-computing-with-cpp/)
course developed by [Dr. James Hetherington](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/people/james)
and [Dr. Matt Clarkson](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42). It is currently maintained by [Dr. Jim Dobson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jim-dobson).

Build Instructions
-------

Build and run instructions are left as an excercise for the student. Examples of how to build using cmake were given in lectures and in the other CMakeCatch2 example projects.
